            <p>
                The game of Deal Or No Deal starts with 26 numbered cases. Each case contains a cash amount ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. Your goal as the player 
                is of course to win the most amount of money! To explain the rules we have a list of steps or guidelines to help you play! 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The player will pick a briefcase that they own, this briefcase has the cash amount you'll win or sell to the Banker, so choose wisely but don't worry! You'll have a 
                    chance to switch your cases later on! <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The aim of the game is either to sell your case off to the Banker for the most amount of money you can, or go all in and win the cash prizes in the cases. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player will then choose cases from the case display to remove from play, you, of course, want to remove the lowest cash amounts to increase your
                    chances of winning more!! The amounts you remove will also inform the Banker's decision on how much they will offer for your case!
                    If you remove low cash amounts then your case is more likely to be a high prize, which will net you a bigger offer from the Banker and vice versa! <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In each round the player will remove a specific number of cases from play, until the banker will call with an offer after each round.
                    In the first round you will remove 6, then 5, then 4, etc... until you start opening one case at a time. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the Banker submits his offer, it's up to you to accept it or not! If you do, then congrats! You can still continue the game to see if you would've won more or not!
                    Otherwise, you'll continue the game with more rounds. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When only two cases remain, your case and one last case, you can choose to switch them or keep your current case. Whatever case you have afterwards is the amount you'll win!<br>
                </li>
                <li>That's it! Hope you have fun!</li>
