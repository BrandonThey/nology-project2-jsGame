This is a JS game as a beginner project.

Description:
I created the game of Deal or No Deal to practice and implement new skills in Javascript, HTML and CSS. The application runs a web browser version of the game Deal or No Deal and allows the user to play a full game of Deal or No Deal, by using javascript functions and event listeners along with HTML buttons and elements, with CSS stylings. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS in order to demostrate newly learned skills. There were some issues of animation and sound effects and in the future i would like to improve upon these.

How to install and run the project:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Run the project using a server hosting application, such as Live Server on VSCode
4. Play the game on the browser!
5. Alternatively, this game will be hosted on github pages
